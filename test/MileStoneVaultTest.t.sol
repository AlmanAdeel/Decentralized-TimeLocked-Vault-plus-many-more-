/*These tests were written before the VaultFactory contract was introduced, 
    so they are not based on the current factory-based deployment structure.

    At the time, each vault was deployed and tested individually to ensure 
    that their core functionalities were working as intended.

    Since then, changes have been made and the VaultFactory is now the primary 
    contract used to deploy vaults. If you notice any inconsistencies between 
    these tests and the current codebase, don't worry â€” all core vault 
    functionalities have already been validated.

    These tests are here for reference and for verifying the standalone 
    behavior of each vault contract.
